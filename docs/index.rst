Welcome to BLEXT
=================================

BLEXT is a blog website where you can finish the whole "edit - store - publish" blogging process in one place. It was initially designed to provide blog writers **a better blogging experience**, where they can focus on their creation of their masterpieces and anything else (including publishing, loading & storing, theming and etc.) will be neatly done by BLEXT. It is highly recommended to use the supporting `markdown desktop editor`_ for a sublime blogging experience.

The code is open source, and `available on github`_.
